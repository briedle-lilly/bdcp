# bdcp
Functions for approximating the bootstrap discrepancy comparison probability (BDCP).  Currently, the package contains functions for a linear and logistic regression simulation settings.  The functions output a data.frame consisting of the Wald, score and likelihood ratio test p-values, as well as BDCP estimates under each of the corresponding discrepancy functions.  The p-values and BDCPs are calculated under both a full and partial null hypothesis test setting.
